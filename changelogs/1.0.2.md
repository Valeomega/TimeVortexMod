# Version 1.0.2

## Destination Configurator UI Rework & Polish

This release completely overhauls the Destination Configurator (Keypad) interface for a significantly better user experience.

### Improvements & Features
- **New Scrollable Lists**: Replaced the cumbersome tooltip-based selection with proper scrollable lists for both Dimensions and Saved Locations.
- **Improved Layout**: Reorganized and aligned fields for X, Y, Z, Rotation, and Dimension for better readability.
- **Search Filtering**: Added text filtering for both Dimension and Location lists to make finding targets easier.
- **Input Validation**: Coordinate fields (X, Y, Z) and the Rotation field now only accept numeric values, preventing accidental invalid entries.
- **Smarter Saving**: Saving a location now uses the TARDIS's **current exterior position** instead of the target set on the console.

### Admin Commands
- **TARDIS Deletion**: Added `/tardis delete` command for admins to completely remove a TARDIS (entity and interior) and its associated data by looking at it.

### Fixes
- **UI Polish**: Fixed alignment issues where labels overlapped with input fields.
- **Button Spacing**: Resolved button overlaps in both the Destination and Locations screens.
- **Input Handling**: Fixed an issue where typing the inventory key (default 'E') while a text field was focused would unexpectedly close the GUI.
- **Crash/Bug Fixes**: Resolved issues where dimension selection was difficult or buggy due to mouseover detection problems.
