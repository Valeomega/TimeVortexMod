# Changelog - v1.0.6

## TARDIS Polish and Fixes

### Core Logic & Animations
- **Animation Synchronization**: Replaced increment-based travel time with a fixed constant system. Dematerialization is now **strictly** 20 seconds, and Rematerialization is **strictly** 24 seconds, driven by a fixed 20 TPS clock rather than standard world tick speed.
- **Fixed Travel Time**: TARDIS travel now takes a fixed duration (30 seconds total) unless the destination chunk needs time to load.
- **Travel Safety**: Added a check to prevent initiating dematerialization if the TARDIS is already at the target location.
    - Users will now receive a "Already at target location" message instead of wasting energy/time.

### Block Entities & UI
- **Monitor Priority Swap**: Changed the default display for the Monitor.
    - **Powered (Active)**: Now shows **Exterior Info** (Your current location and status).
    - **Unpowered (Idle)**: Now shows **Target Info** (Your set destination and estimates).
- **Keypad Data Persistence**: Fixed a bug where saved locations would vanish after traveling or reloading the world. Locations are now properly saved to the block's NBT.
- **Keypad UI Reformatting**: Updated the saved location list to be more readable.
    - New format: `Name (X Y Z) | Dimension` (e.g., `Home (100 64 -200) | overworld`).
    - Improved selection logic to correctly handle the new format when clicking list entries.
