# Version 1.0.1

## Server Compatibility and Ownership Fixes

This release addresses critical issues affecting dedicated servers, specifically resolving ownership validation failures, synchronization bugs during TARDIS flight, and door exit failures.

### Bug Fixes
- **Ownership Validation**: Upgraded TARDIS ownership logic to use unique player IDs (UUIDs) instead of username hashes. This resolves the **"This TARDIS is not yours"** error preventing players from using their keys on servers.
    - *Note*: Existing TARDISes placed in version 1.0.0 might need to be replaced if ownership interactions fail.
- **Infinite Dematerialization**: Fixed a client-server synchronization issue that caused the TARDIS to get stuck in the dematerialization animation loop on multiplayer servers.
- **Door Exit Failure**: Fixed the door not allowing exit from the TARDIS by searching all dimensions for the exterior entity instead of only the target dimension.
- **Improved Security**: Strengthened ownership checks in `DoorBlock` and `VortexInterfaceBlock` to prevent unauthorized access or modification.
